# Queue Implementation in C (Static & Dynamic)

This project implements an ordinary queue using both static (array-based)
and dynamic (heap-based) memory allocation techniques in C.

## Features
- Static queue using array
- Dynamic queue using heap memory
- Automatic resizing using realloc
- Menu-driven program
- Peek front and rear operations

## Data Structures Used
- Queue
- Array
- Dynamic Memory Allocation

## Concepts Demonstrated
- FIFO principle
- malloc, realloc, free
- Memory management
- Modular programming

## How to Run
```bash
gcc queuemanagement.c -o queue
./queue
